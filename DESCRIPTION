Description: This package implements the Recombination Model proposed by Jianping Sun PhD, University of North Carolina Greensboro. The model estimates the unknown distribution of ancestor SNP sequences from a sample of observed descendant SNP sequences, using Markov chain composite likelihood and hierarchical estimation to account for computational burden and complex parameter space constraints. This package contains a preliminary version of functions that carry out this estimation for Markov chain orders of 1, 2, and 3 only.
