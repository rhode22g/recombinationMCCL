# recombinationMCCL
## this is a preliminary version of the package which can carry out the marginal estimation and joint distribution reconstruction for m=1,2,3


# BUILT IN DATA

This package includes one built-in dataset, both the raw data and a version of the data converted into binary sequences. The raw data comes from the International HapMap Project (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/hapmap/phasing/2009-02_phaseIII/HapMap3_r2/).

The raw data is available under `yri_trio_1.csv`. This corresponds to data on Chromosome 1 from the YRI population Trios data.

The converted data is available under `yri_trio_1_binary.csv`.
